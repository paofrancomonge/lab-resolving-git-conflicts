My name is Paola Franco and IÂ´m a proud chilanga working for Amazon MX. I have been working as a brand specialist in Amazon for almost a year and it has been a very challenging but incredible experience. As Amazon is a global company based on data, I noticed I has to step up my game in data-analytics to have a better performance in my job and therefore more opportunities to be promoted. I have no experience with data tools and I am excited to achieve these hard skills with the help of the Ironhack team. I decided this bootcamp was my best option as it was a recommendation from a colegue who is actually pretty good in coding and managing data. That is my expectation when graduating from the course. 

After the course I definitely see myself continuing working for Amazon for another year (probably in another team) and then applying to a master in Europe. I feel like the bootcamp will also be benefitial for me in that sense, I will be more prepared to take the best of the master. My expectation is that after the master, I can find a job opportunity in Europe and have the international experience to complement my profile. I really enjoy my actual job so in the future I also see myself working in the commercial/marketing area in whatever company I am in (preferably related to e-commerce). My ideal job would be brand/product manager for a global company that offers me the chance to manage different markets.
